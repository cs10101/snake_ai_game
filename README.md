# snake_ai_game
This applications uses reinforcement learning to train an agent to play the retro game 'snake'. This application is based on an online tutorial from freecodecamps YouTube channel, I've made my own modifications to the application to help it run slightly better but the link to the original tutorail can be found below. Please note that this newer version of this project has only been tested on Mac devices and may not work well on windows devices.

The development of this application has taught me many things both about reinforcment learning and how to best use Git and GitHub. Additionally this project has taught me how to problem solve and analys different errors within the program while making modifications to the code.

# New features to come in the future:
1) snake agent can learn to not run into itself as much as it currently does
2) more apples will appear on the screen
3) larger game area for the snake to play in
4) pause command to run in the terminal to pause current training without closing the application
5) possible UI to view training stats in a more appealing formate
6) switching epsilon decay rates relative to static training batches or continuous training session.
